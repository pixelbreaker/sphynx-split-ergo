# openscad-ts
openscad fully "typed"
wrapper for open scad to generate source files.  Main goal is solve some issues I have with openscad language structure.

1.  IDE assistance - as a fully typed API, vscode will be able to guide proper usage and documentation on each method will show up instantly.
2.  fluent API, i kept all the keywords the same as original language except i made it fluent as well. i.e.
3.  benefit from javascript's first class functions and module system.
